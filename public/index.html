        <p>Hello ðŸ˜€</p>

        <p>Welcome to Shape Comparisons. Thank you for joining us today.</p>

        <p>For this activity you will be asked to compare the size of two black boxes - a static one at the top of the screen and a changing one at the bottom of the screen. Here's how this works:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the small black circle at the botton of the screen to start</li>
            <li>If the box at the bottom of the screen is larger than the one at the top, then click the "larger" button, and if it is smaller, click the "smaller" button</li>
            <li>To get your next box, click the small black circle that appears at the bottom of the screen</li>
            <li>Keep going with your comparisons until the activity concludes</li>
        </ul>
          <b>Please do this as quickly and accurately as possible. </b>  </p> 

        <p>We will start you off with a practice round where you can try this out. The entire activity will take about 15 minutes.</p>
