<!--        <p>Hello ðŸ˜€</p>

        <p>Welcome to Shape Comparisons. Thank you for joining us today.</p>-->

        <p>The following experiment is conducted as part of the class
            CS 279 - Research Topics in Human Computer Interaction, at Harvard University.</p>

        <p>In this activity you will be presented with two black boxes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a static one at the top of the screen and</li>
            <li>a changing one at the bottom of the screen.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Your task is to judge how the area of the box at the bottom compares to the area
        of the box at the top.</b>
        <br> <br>
        Here's how this works:
        <ul>
            <li>click the small black circle at the botton of the screen to start</li>
            <li>if the box at the bottom of the screen is larger than the one at the top, then click
                the "larger" button; <br>if it is smaller, click the "smaller" button</li>
            <li>to get your next box, click the small black circle that appears at the bottom of the screen</li>
            <li>keep going with your comparisons until the activity concludes.</li>
        </ul>
          <b>It is important to do this as quickly and accurately as possible. </b>

        <p>We will start you off with a practice round where you can try this out. The entire activity will take
            about 10 minutes.</p>
